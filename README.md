Healthie was founded to meet local and global emergency needs in the UN SDGs with a special focus on good health and wellbeing through Google technology. Despite our vision of winning the 3rd SDG, we have ambitious plans for frequent use by more than 30 users across Indonesia during user acceptance testing. This user-centricity will help us analyze effectiveness and continue developing our solutions. By holding a short presentation and a strong commitment, we are confident in our vision to achieve progress towards the SDGs, while delivering on our financial targets to invest further in research, development and meaningful change.
